SovereignT is an application built to help educate people on the most important aspects of geography and economics.  At first there will be 5 possible countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and Turkey) to compare to the United States.  The extension of this idea will eventually involve comparisions between any two sovereign nations and a game system to support trivia questions to help demonstrate the user's newly learned facts and a badge system as a reward/tracking function.
